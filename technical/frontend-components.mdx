## Overview

The Job Manager frontend is built using a **Headless UI Architecture** with Next.js, separating business logic (hooks) from visual presentation (UI components). This page provides detailed C4 component diagrams for each feature module.

<Info>
  All feature modules share common infrastructure: **Fetcher Utilities** for API calls, **Constants Manager** for URLs, and the **bamboo-ui** shared component library.
</Info>

## Architecture Pattern

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Headless Hooks" icon="code">
    Encapsulate business logic, state management, and event handlers without rendering UI
  </Card>
  <Card title="UI Components" icon="palette">
    Reusable visual primitives from bamboo-ui that consume hooks for behavior
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Services" icon="gear">
    API integration layer using Fetcher Utilities for backend communication
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validation Schemas" icon="shield-check">
    Zod schemas for client-side validation of form inputs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Infrastructure

All feature components connect to these shared containers:

| Container | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Page** | Next.js | Root page container and routing |
| **Fetcher Utilities** | TypeScript | HTTP/HTTPS requests to backend |
| **Constants Manager** | TypeScript | Centralized URL and config management |
| **bamboo-ui** | React + TailwindCSS | Shared UI component library |

## Signup Component

Implements multi-path registration flow with credentials and Google SSO support. By leveraging a Headless UI pattern, the Next.js page remains a pure composition layer that delegates validation and API interactions to specialized hooks and services.

</Frame>

### Component Breakdown

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Signup Service">
    Encapsulates the specific business logic for creating a new company account. Prepares the data payload and manages success/error redirection.

    - **Internal:** Calls Fetcher Utilities to submit data
    - **External:** Indirectly communicates with the Identity Provider via the fetcher to persist the new user
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Signup UI Form">
    Renders the visual registration form elements (Company Name, Email, Password, Country Listbox).

    - **Internal:** Consumes ValidateSchema for validation rules and passes specific field children/styles to the generic Headless UI Form wrapper
    - Displays real-time validation feedback
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ValidateSchema">
    Defines the strict Zod validation rules for registration (e.g., "Password must have 1 special char", "Phone must be digits").

    - **Internal:** Used strictly by Signup UI Form to validate form state before submission is allowed, isolating validation logic from UI rendering
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSO Service">
    Manages the OAuth 2.0 handshake logic for third-party providers. Constructs the correct authorization URLs.

    - **Internal:** Calls Fetcher Utilities to retrieve provider-specific redirect URLs
    - **External:** Initiates the browser redirect to external Identity Providers (e.g., Google)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSO UI Button">
    Renders the branded "Sign up with Google" button.

    - **Internal:** Consumes the generic Headless UI Button for interaction behavior but applies provider-specific branding styles

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Reusable Components

| Component | Hook | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Headless UI Button** | Headless Button Hook | Consistent button behavior, preventing double-clicks while loading |
| **Headless UI Form** | Headless Form Hook | Form state, isDirty, isSubmitting flags, handleSubmit handlers |
| **Headless UI Combobox** | Headless Combobox Hook | Country selection dropdown with search |

## Login Component

Facilitates secure authentication with credentials and Google SSO. Mirroring the signup architecture, the Next.js page functions as a strict composition layer, delegating complex authentication state and token management to specialized Services and Headless Hooks.
