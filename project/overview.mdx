## DEVision Platform

Vietnamese tradition emphasizes the proverb **"An Cư Lạc Nghiệp"** (Settled and Flourished), highlighting the necessity of establishing a solid and fulfilling career as the foundation for prosperity and personal happiness.

DEVision was created to embody this principle by bridging job applicants in the Computer Science fields with their potential employers.

### Platform Goals

Our primary goals are to:

1. **Empower Applicants** - Help job seekers find roles that align with their technical skills and career aspirations
2. **Assist Companies** - Enable organizations to attract top talents that match their specific technical demands and long-term vision

### System Architecture

DEVision is architected into two core subsystems:

## Development Methodology

<Warning>
All teams must follow professional software development practices as outlined in the requirements.
</Warning>

### Collaborative Development
- **Methodology**: SCRUM or Kanban
- **Tools**: [Tuturuuu](https://tuturuuu.com/d38c5b88-7e9a-46e3-9752-9cff835eff24/tasks/boards/be15d431-b796-4394-b340-c78890de3e79) Kanban board for task management
- **Reviews**: Bi-weekly sprint reviews with the lecturer

### Key Practices
- Iterative development approach
- Frequent GitHub commits
- Professional communication
- Active participation in meetings

### Meeting Policy
- Attendance is mandatory
- 24-hour advance notice required for absences
- Valid justification and evidence required
- Penalties for unexcused absences

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1 - November 28, 2025

**Deliverables:**
- Conceptual Data Model (ER Diagram)
- System Architecture Diagrams
- 30-page Technical Report
- GitHub contribution proof

**Key Requirements:**
- Design data model with justifications
- Create architecture diagrams (UML or C4)
- Present system design decisions
- Demonstrate frequent GitHub usage

### Milestone 2 - January 13, 2026

**Deliverables:**
- Fully implemented system
- Deployed application (Docker/Kubernetes)
- API integration with Job Applicant subsystem
- Database initialization scripts

**Key Requirements:**
- Implement all functional requirements
- Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes
- Provide and consume APIs
- Demo integrated system

## Initial Data Requirements

The system must be initialized with:

### Administrator
- One ADMIN account for system management

### Companies
- 2 Freemium accounts (2 job posts each)
- 2 Premium accounts with specific subscriptions:
  - Software Engineer hiring (React, Spring Boot, Docker)
  - Data Engineer hiring (Python, AWS, Snowflake)

### Applicants
- 5 APPLICANT accounts
  - 2 from Vietnam, 2 from Singapore, 1 from another nation
  - 2 Premium accounts (one from Vietnam, one from Singapore)

## Architecture Complexity Levels

### Simplex (Basic)
- N-Tier (Layer-based) architecture
- Frontend and backend separation
- Repository layer for queries
- Basic authentication and features

### Medium
- Modular Monolith backend
- Componentized frontend
- Internal/External APIs
- REST HTTP Helper classes
- Advanced validation and security

### Ultimo (Advanced)
- Microservices architecture
- Headless UI components
- Kafka message broker
- Database sharding
- Service discovery and API Gateway
- Kubernetes deployment (bonus)

## Design Evaluation Criteria

All architectural decisions should be evaluated on:

1. **Maintainability** - Easy to understand, update, and test
2. **Extensibility** - New features added with minimal impact
3. **Resilience** - Continues functioning under unexpected conditions
4. **Scalability** - Handles increased load efficiently
5. **Security** - Protected from unauthorized access and threats
6. **Performance** - Quick and efficient response to requests
