## About SGJM Team

SGJM Team is a dedicated software engineering team working on the **Job Manager Subsystem** of the DEVision platform as part of the EEET2582/ISYS3461 course at RMIT University.

### Team Name Origin

**Saint Giong** (Thánh Gióng) is one of the four immortal heroes in Vietnamese folklore, symbolizing:

- **Strength and determination** in overcoming challenges
