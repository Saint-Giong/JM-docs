## Development Workflow

### Git Branch Strategy

The team follows a feature branch workflow:

```
main
  └── develop
        ├── feature/auth-sso
        ├── feature/job-post-crud
        ├── bugfix/login-validation
        └── docs/api-reference
```

### Commit Conventions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commit Message Format">
    All commits follow the conventional commit format:

    ```
    <type>(<scope>): <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer]
    ```

    **Types:**
    - `feat`: New feature
    - `fix`: Bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation changes
    - `style`: Code style/formatting
    - `refactor`: Code refactoring
    - `test`: Adding/updating tests
    - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit Frequency Requirements">
    Team members are expected to:

    - Commit at least **once per working day** when actively developing
    - Push changes before end of day to enable collaboration
    - Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
    - Reference task IDs in commit messages when applicable
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Code Review Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Pull Request">
    Developer creates PR from feature branch to develop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Reviewers">
    At least one team member must review the code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Feedback">
