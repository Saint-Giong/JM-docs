<Warning>
Uses OR logic for multiple skills
</Warning>

**Skill Tag Search:**
- Filter by technical skill tags
- Example: Search for "Kafka, Java, MongoDB"
- Returns applicants with Kafka OR Java OR MongoDB
- Not all three skills required

**Common Skill Tags:**
- Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust
- Frameworks: React, Spring Boot, Django, Angular
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
- Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Git

### Performance Optimizations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lazy Loading (5.2.3)">
    - Search results loaded incrementally
    - Improves performance with large datasets
    - Smooth scrolling experience
    - Reduces initial load time
  </Accordion>

- Can be changed by user
- Optimizes for primary user base

## Search Interface

### Basic Search Example

```typescript
{
  "location": {
    "type": "COUNTRY",
    "value": "Vietnam"
  },
  "education": ["BACHELOR", "MASTER"],
  "workExperience": {
    "type": "KEYWORD",
    "value": "software engineer"
  },
  "employmentTypes": ["FULL_TIME", "INTERNSHIP"]
}
```

### Advanced Search with Skills

```typescript
{
  "location": {
    "type": "CITY",
    "value": "Ho Chi Minh City"
  },
  "skills": ["React", "Spring Boot", "Docker"],
  "education": ["MASTER"],
  "fullTextSearch": "backend development microservices"
}
```

## Search Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Enters Criteria] --> B{Location Type?}
    B -->|Country| C[Query Country Shard]
    B -->|City| D[Query Relevant Shards]
    C --> E[Apply Filters]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Full-Text Search]
    F --> G[Skill Tag Filtering]
    G --> H[Sort Results]
    H --> I[Lazy Load Display]
    I --> J[Show with Skill Tags]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Case-Insensitive Search

<Info>
All text searches must be case-insensitive to ensure comprehensive results
</Info>

**Examples:**
- "Software Engineer" = "software engineer" = "SOFTWARE ENGINEER"
- "python" = "Python" = "PYTHON"

### Performance Considerations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Index Fields">
    Create database indexes on searchable fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use FTS Engine">
    Implement full-text search engine (Elasticsearch, MongoDB Atlas Search)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Pagination">
    Use cursor-based or offset pagination for lazy loading
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cache Results">
    Cache frequently accessed searches in Redis
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Integration

<Warning>
Applicant profile data must be consumed from Job Applicant subsystem API
</Warning>

**Required API Calls:**
- GET /api/applicants/search
